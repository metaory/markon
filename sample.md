## Auto-Save & Data Management

### LocalStorage Auto-Save

> [!TIP]
> Your content is automatically saved to your browser's localStorage as you type!

**How it works:**
- **Automatic**: Content saves instantly as you type - no manual save needed
- **Persistent**: Your work survives browser restarts, crashes, and computer reboots
- **Private**: Data stays on your device - never sent to any servers
- **Unlimited**: No storage limits for your markdown documents

### Managing Your Content

**To save to a file:**
1. Use `Ctrl/Cmd + S` to save as `.md` file to your computer
2. Or copy content to clipboard and paste into any text editor

**To load from a file:**
1. Use `Ctrl/Cmd + O` to open existing `.md` files
2. Content will automatically load and start auto-saving


> [!NOTE]
> LocalStorage is per-browser and per-device. Content won't sync across different browsers or computers.
